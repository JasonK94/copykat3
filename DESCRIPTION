Title: COPYKAT3: Inference of genomic copy number and subclonal structure of human tumors from high-throughput single cell RNA-seq data
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Ruli Gao
Maintainer: Ruli Gao <ruli.gao@northwestern.edu>
Description: COPYKAT3 is a computational tool using integrative Bayesian approaches to identify genome-wide aneuploidy at 5MB resolution in single cells to separate aneuploid (tumor) cells from diploid (normal) cells, and tumor subclones using high-throughput sc-RNAseq data.
